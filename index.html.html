<h3 style= " font-size:20px ; "><u>Discription of this web page:-</u> <br><br>The topic of the poject is integrated with three subjects  English, Maths and Science which contains information and causes of pollution.This Web page is made by the students of Class:- VIII 10 .Now lets start with a basic question. </h3>
<h4 style=" font-size:40px ; "> <i><u>What is Pollution?</u><i> </h4>
<p  style= " font-size:30px ; " style= "font-family:verdana;" >Pollution, also called environmental pollution, the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form. The major kinds of pollution, usually classified by environment, are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. Modern society is also concerned about specific types of pollutants, such as noise pollution, light pollution, and plastic pollution. Pollution of all kinds can have negative effects on the environment and wildlife and often impacts human health and well-being.</p>
<br>
<h5 style= " font-size:30px" ><u><i>There are four types of Pollution <i> </u></h5>
<ol>
  <li style= " font-size:30px">Air Pollution</li>
  <li style= " font-size:30px"> Water Pollution</li>
  <li style= " font-size:30px"> Land Pollution</li>
  <li style= " font-size:30px"> Noise Pollution</li>
</ol>
<h6 style= " font-size:30px"><u> Now lets us see some discription about these four pollutions</u></h6>
<ol>
<li style = " font-size:30px"><u><b>Air Pollution:-</b></u></li>
  <br>
  <p style = " font-size:30px">Air is a mixture of different gases which forms one of the important constituents of our environment, and is essentilas for the survival of living beings.  Contamination of air by substance which have harmful effects on both living and non-living components of the biosphere air pollution. The substances which causes air pollution are called air pollutants.Air pollution is caused by a combination of gaseous and particulate pollutants such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen dioxide emitted from point sources such as factories and motor vehicles that burn fuel. Some gaseous emissions are visible to the eye and sometimes may even diffuse into the atmosphere and become invisible. Particulate pollution, on the other hand, such as soot and black carbon, is always visible. </p>

  <li style = " font-size:30px"><u><b>Water Pollution:-</b></u></li>
  <p style = " font-size:30px">Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, in such a manner that negatively affects its legitimate uses.[1]: 6  Water pollution reduces the ability of the body of water to provide the ecosystem services that it would otherwise provide. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into these water bodies. In addition to damage to many species, water pollution can also lead to water-borne diseases for people.</p>

  <li style = " font-size:30px"><u><b>Land Pollution:-</b></u></li>
  <p style = " font-size:30px" >Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals. Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapour from the contaminants, or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil.</p>

  <li style = " font-size:30px"><u><b>Noise Pollution:-</b></u></li>
  <p style = " font-size:30px" >Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of them harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems. Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, wind turbines, explosions, and people.</p>
